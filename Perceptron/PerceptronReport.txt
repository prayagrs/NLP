Part III. You are welcome to reuse code you wrote for assignment 1,
but we would like to know how you handled the following tasks.

5. How did you calculate precision, recall and F1 score? If you used a
separate script, please give the name of the script and describe how
to run it.
Based on the classify script of Naive Bayes I calculated the precision, recall and F1 score.
Maintained all those variables in the per_classify script and applied the same formulae as that of Naive Bayes.
The only difference here was, classification was based on the alpha value obtained in the calculation process.
If the value was greater than zero I classified it as spam or else ham. Comparing these values against the weight's obtained
from the learn files the value of alpha was calculated.


6. How did you separate 10% of the training data? If you used a
separate script, please give the name of the script and describe how
to run it. Explain how you or your code choose the files.

I calculated the number of spam and ham files present in all the folders of the training data.
Took the 10% of the files and based on the number selected the files from spam and ham folder.
For both the folders I divided the 10% in three portions and based on that selected half number of files
from top and the other half from bottom. Repeated the same technique for all the folders.
