# Naive Bayes

A naive Bayes classifier to identify whether the given text is spam or Ham using add-one smoothing on training data. Two programs: nblearn.py will learn a naive Bayes model from the training data, and nbclassify.py will use the model to classify new data.

#Perceptron

The goal of this assignment is to get some experience implementing the simple but effective machine
learning model, the perceptron, and applying it to a binary text classification task.
